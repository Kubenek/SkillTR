## Gate Nodes

### Basics

A gate node is a big node that requires a hard-to-get "specific" key or a custom value of "common" keys.

Gate nodes act like checkpoints, a way to see that your skill and your knowledge is evolving. 

### Interaction

Just like in the normal [nodes]("./nodes.md"), the unlocking system works the same, you just need either a specific key or an amount of common keys.

### Possible results

A possible result of opening a gate nodes is unlocking a new tree branch, which you can use to learn and level up your knowledge furthermore.
Another outcome could be earning access to another tree template, a gift for completing this one.
